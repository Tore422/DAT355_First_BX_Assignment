Exercise 1:

a) 
It is possible to define a get(int, int) that will result in the product of the two numbers.<br>
get(int a, int b) { <br>
    return a * b; <br>
}

It is not possible to define a get(int) that will result in the two different numbers that the number is a product of.<br>
The best thing the function could do is returning a list of possible pairs,<br>
that multiplied with each other result in the same product<br>
(e.g., <br>
1 * 10 = 10,<br>
2 * 5 = 10, <br>
5 * 2 = 10, <br>
10 * 1 = 10, <br>
-10 * -1 = 10, <br>
-2 * -5 = 10, etc.).
